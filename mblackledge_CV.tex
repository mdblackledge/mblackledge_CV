\section{Professional Experience}
\location{Director | 2021-present, Diafora Medical Ltd.}
Co-founded Diafora Medical Ltd. to commercialise my Artificial Intelligence algorithm for accelerating acquisition of clinical Diffusion-Weighted MRI scans. Responsibilities include active engagement in board meetings, overall strategy of company direction, authorship of patents, leading clinical trial development, and raising more than £3 million to begin development of the invented techniques.

\vspace{10pt}

\location{Team Leader of Computational Imaging | 2019-present \newline Institute of Cancer Research}
Lead a team of postdoctoral research fellows,  PhD, and MSc students, combining clinical imaging with state-of-the-art image processing and artificial intelligence to solve clinical problems in oncology.
 
\vspace*{20pt}
\begin{tightemize}
\item Accelerated acquisition of diffusion-weighted MRI using \textbf{deep-learning}, improving patient experience and capacity of radiology departments.
\item \textbf{Domain-adaptation AI} for automatic segmentation of organs at risk in pelvic radiotherapy planning on the MR-Linac.
\item \textbf{Whole-body MRI} analytics for assessing inter-lesion response heterogeneity in patients receiving treatment for advanced prostate cancer.
\item \textbf{Machine learning} for evaluation of intra-tumoral heterogeneity in soft-tissue sarcoma and metastatic bone disease using quantitative MRI.
\item \textbf{Bayesian inference} for generalised imaging biomarker repeatability assessment in quantitative imaging clinical trials.
\item Combining \textbf{quantitative MRI} with super-resolution ultrasound for multi-resolution assessment of breast cancer response to radiotherapy.
\end{tightemize}

\sectionsep

\location{Postdoctoral Research Fellow | 2011-2019, Institute of Cancer Research}
Won multiple rounds of competitive funding to pursue two projects, initially developing automated segmentation of total body disease from whole-body MRI, and subsequently turning this technology into an approved medical device. 

\vspace*{10pt}
\begin{tightemize}
\item Pioneering in-silico approaches for validation of clinical imaging biomarkers using advanced \textbf{histological analysis} of preclinical cancer models.
\item Steering development of new \textbf{regulatory approved software} for automatic response assessment of patients with metastatic cancer using whole-body MRI.
\item Developed novel AI-based \textbf{image segmentation} approaches for whole-body MRI and PET/CT in patients with advanced prostate cancer and lymphoma.
\item Invented and implemented a new software platform (pyOsiriX) that accelerates prototyping of imaging research tools, and facilitates the interaction between imaging scientists and radiologists through a familiar image viewing platform.
\item Led whole-body MRI protocol development and promoted its use within \textbf{multi-center clinical trials}. 
\end{tightemize}

\end{minipage}

\newpage
\section{Leadership and Mentoring}
\vspace*{10pt}
\begin{tightemize}
\item Experience of leading small-medium research teams in image-processing, MRI physics, and artificial intelligence; currently six PhD students and three postdoctoral fellows (one PhD student have recently defended their thesis).
\item Mentored seven summer studentships/interns in the development of innovative image processing and/or MRI development projects.
\item Management of grant funds and resources, both within personal fellowships and project awards.
\item Regular delivery of timely updates to funding bodies highlighting the progress of my research; authorship of final reports and lay summaries to research ethics committees to convey clinical trial results. 
\item Chair regular meetings to ensure that research project milestones are reached on time.
\item Lead a number of clinical trials, including development of overall research methodology, statistical analysis plans, power calculations, imaging protocol manuals, and patient information sheets.
